This program will recreate a linked list without using the list library. Linked
lists normally have many elements in them that connect to one another through
links. These elements are known as nodes. This program simulates some of the
functions that are offered in the list libraries including get_length, get_head,
print, clear, push_front, push_back, insert, sort_ascending, sort_descending, 
and count_prime.

It is a simple program to run because the test_linked_list.cpp file has most of 
the content that needs to be run, and it was given to us. All the user needs
to do is make and run the files and then select 2, which will run the test.
The program can then be continued by pressing enter and seeing how the tests 
are run.

There are a few limitations with this program, because the test file is already
created. If the user wants to test different elements, they would need to change
the test_linked_list file before making and running the program.
