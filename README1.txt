This program will create a fractal using recursive functions. Recursive functions are functions 
that call themselves and repeat until they finish. This can create patterns in code such as this. 
This code will create a fractal that has lines of asterisks, starting with fewer then having a 
full line of them in the middle and then tapering off to look like the beginning of the output. 
The program will ask for two seperate numbers from the user. The first number will be the amount 
of stars in the longeest line in the middle of the output, and the second number will be the
amount of spaces from the left border of the screen. This code is found in main and the
pattern function is found right above main.

Once the user makes and runs the file, they can select 1 to run the recursive fractal program. 
Once they select this, they are asked for two numbers and the program should do the rest and 
output the patter onto the screen.

There are a few limitations to this pattern, there is no way to input negative numbers to see 
how the fractal is effected, and there is no way for the fractal to change pattern
